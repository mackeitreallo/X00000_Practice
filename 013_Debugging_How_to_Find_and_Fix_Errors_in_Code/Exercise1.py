#Original Code to Check

#number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))
#
#if number % 2 = 0:
#  print("This is an even number.")
#else:
#  print("This is an odd number.")

#My Solution
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
